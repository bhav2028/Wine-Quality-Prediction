# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Wine quality prediction refers to the process of using machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to analyze and predict the quality of wine based on various input factors. The goal is to build models that can accurately determine the quality of a wine based on its chemical properties and other characteristics.

In this project:

1] First, the dataset is preprocessed, which includes tasks such as handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2] Then the with the use of random forest classifier the dataset is divided into train and test data.

3] by using the pickle package a model.pkl file is created for the predicition.

4] A app is created using Flask framework and the model.pkl file is uploaded in it for futher predicition.
